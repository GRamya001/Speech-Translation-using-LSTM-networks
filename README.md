# Speech-Translation-using-LSTM-networks
This repository contains a clear explaination on how LSTM(Long short term memory networks) are used in speech translation and how encoder decoder architecture 
is used in real time speech translation. Code uses googletrans api and pyaudio to capture voice users voice and then convert translated voice in a mp3 file.
It will played automatically by system once the user finishes her/his sentence.
